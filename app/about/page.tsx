      <br />
      <p>
        As a passionate Software Engineering student at SLIIT, my journey into
        the world of technology began with a simple fascination: how things work
        behind the scenes. This curiosity ignited a commitment to not only
        understand programming languages but to master them. With expertise in
        the MERN stack, I thrive on crafting seamless web applications that
        enhance user experiences. During my time at SLIIT, I led the development
        of an ordering system for Ambasewana Restaurant, leveraging Firebase,
        Express, Node, and React. This project not only reduced queues but
        transformed the restaurant's online presence, showcasing my ability to
        merge technology with real-world impact. My experience with self-driven
        projects has sharpened my skills in PHP, Java, and UI/UX design using
        Figma, allowing me to create intuitive interfaces that delight users.
        I'm driven by continuous learning and a desire to bridge the gap between
        functionality and aesthetics. I envision a future where my skills
        contribute to innovative software solutions that make lives easier and
        more enjoyable. If you're looking for a dedicated intern or collaborator
        who is eager to bring fresh ideas to the table, let's connect! Iâ€™m
        always excited to explore new opportunities in the tech space.
